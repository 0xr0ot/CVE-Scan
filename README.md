# CVE-Scan
Scan systems with NMap and parse the output to a list of CVE's, CWE's and DPE's

## Goals:
 * Scan a system with NMap or any other scanning tool and use the scan to analyse the systems for vulnerabilities
 * Have the posibility for multiple input formats (NMap scan, xml, Json, etc)
 * Use CVE-Search to enhance the scan to add more information
 * Have multiple export formats as well as webbrowser component
 
### Optional:
* Automatically download known scripts to use on exploits
